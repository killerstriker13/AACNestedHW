### MP5: Augmentive and Alternative Communication Device

Authors: Catie Baker, Samuel A. Rebelsky, Shibam Mukhopadhyay

This is an implementation of an AAC device designed to aid people with speech disabilities.
The GUI panel allows the user to click on images which are spoken out by a text to speech system.
The GUI consists of a homepage where it showcases all the categories that are in this device. When a user selects a specific category by clicking on it, it showcases another set of images related to this category. The user can then click on the image in this category for the text to speech function to activate. The user is also able to add their own categories and save a new AACMappings.txt on the device so that the new categories are always present.
